1.2 (2005-10-07):

	* By popular request, added an option to always show the tray icon,
	  regardless of whether there is new mail. Initial implementation was
	  provided by Patrizio Bassi.
	* Fixed French localization.
	* Added Czech localization (coutersy of Jan Kratochvíl).
	* Made the support for hardware new mail indicators
	  (programmatically-cotnrollable LEDs found on computer cases)
	  more generic and added support to the LED found on Acer
	  laptops in addition to ASUS laptops (on Linux, with the
	  appropriate driver installed).
	  Expert users can use this feature for any other kind of
	  indicators, as long as they're controllable by writing "0" or "1"
	  to a "control file" (which usually resides in /proc on Linux
	  systems). To choose the "control file", edit the
	  "mail.biff.hw_indicator_file" preference.
	* Switched to a more orthodox method of keeping the icon's
          transparency by using the SHAPE extension.
	  For details, see GNOME bug #150726.

1.1 (2005-04-24):

	* Enabled Hebrew localization.
	* Added French localization (courtesy of Jérôme Schell).
	* Added Italian localization (courtesy of Franco Spinelli).
	* Added Catalan localization (courtesy of Toni Hermoso).
	* Added Spanish localization (courtesy of Pat Carr).
	* Added German localization (courtesy of Christoph Vogelbusch).
	* Made the remaining strings (e.g. tray menu) localizable.
	* Allowed compilation on 64-bit platforms.
	* Added support for the New Mail led on ASUS computers
	  (Linux-specific).
	* Fixed a bug which made the Settings dialog fail to display
	  on non-US releases of Thunderbird and Suite. Those releases
	  know nothing about the en-US locale and therefore the
	  locale definition in chrome.rdf should be more detailed.

1.0.7 (2004-12-31):

	* Compiled for Thunderbird 1.0.
	* Ensure we catch 'biff' events from all accounts (by
	  using exactly the same method as Mozilla's "beep"
	  notification uses).
	  
1.0.6 (2004-11-19):

	* Updated as compatible with Thunderbird 0.9.
	* Jump to the first unread message when the
	  "New Mail" notification icon is clicked.
	* Fixed to compile on Solaris C++ compiler
	  (thanks to Jean-Christophe Collet from Sun).

1.0.5 (2004-10-01):

	* Updated to work on Thunderbird 0.8.
	* The build process now supports building separate XPIs for Suite
	  and for Thunderbird.
	* Improved the libegg tray code to alpha-blend with the desktop
	  theme. For more info:
	  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150726
	* Icon changed to:
	  mail/base/skin/icons/message-mail-new.png
	  and now embedded as a PNG with translucency.

1.0.4 (2004-08-21):

	* Fix installation on Mozilla Suite.
	* Add a proper transparency mask to the tray icon and make it centered.
	* Rename project to better indicate its functionality.

1.0.3 (2004-07-03):

	* Update to install on Mozilla Thunderbird 0.7 new extension manager.
	  
1.0.2 (2004-05-26):

	* Update for changes in Mozilla Thunderbird 0.6 / Mozilla 1.7.
	  (See bug 226270.)

1.0.1 (2004-02-14):

	* Update for changes in Mozilla Thunderbird 0.4.
	  (Works with Thunderbird 0.5 and Mozilla 1.6 as well.)
