1.2.3 (?):

	* Support indication via keyboard LEDs.

	* Minor fixes for Thunderbird 2.0.

	* Shipping a single XPI for all platforms since bug 335143
	  is fixed on Thunderbird 2.0.

1.2.2 (2006-04-24):

	* Update install.rdf to mark Thunderbird service releases
	  (e.g. 1.5.0.2) as supported.
	* Ship x86-64 releases in a separate non-platform-targeted
	  XPI until Mozilla bug 335143 is fixed.

1.2.1 (2006-01-07):

	* Change install.rdf to include only the first two segments
	  of the application version we're targetting for.
	  For example, when building with a Thunderbird 1.0.7 target,
	  we'll specify version 1.0 as a requirement.
	* Remove the UUID-per-architecture differentiation.
	  This means users on x86-64 will have to uninstall the previous
	  version.
	* Revert the (mistaken) replacement of the en-US locale
	  with ru-RU.
	* For Thunderbird 1.5, include builds for multiple
	  platforms in the single XPI.
	* Fixed the icon not to be cut off on KDE.

1.2 (2005-12-11):

	* This is the first version to be licensed under
	  the terms of the GPL. This licensing decision is supported
	  by the fact that this project, in addition to original code,
          includes code from libegg (LGPL) and Mozilla (MPL 1.1/LGPL/GPL).
	  For all concerns, all previous releases were GPL-safe too,
	  but this is the first version which actually carries
	  a license statement.
	  Thanks to Manuel López-Ibáñez for bringing up this issue up
	  and for his research.
	* Support for Thunderbird 1.5.
	* By popular request, added an option to always show the tray icon,
	  regardless of whether there is new mail. Initial implementation was
	  provided by Patrizio Bassi.
	* Fixed French localization.
	* Added Czech localization (coutersy of Jan Kratochvíl).
	* Added Russian localization.
	* Made the support for hardware new mail indicators
	  (programmatically-controllable LEDs found on computer cases)
	  more generic and added support to the LED found on Acer
	  laptops in addition to ASUS laptops (on Linux, with the
	  appropriate driver installed).
	  Expert users can use this feature for any other kind of
	  indicators, as long as they're controllable by writing "0" or "1"
	  to a "control file" (which usually resides in /proc on Linux
	  systems). To choose the "control file", edit the
	  "mail.biff.hw_indicator_file" preference.
	* Added a more orthodox method of keeping the icon's
          transparency by using the SHAPE extension.
	  For details, see GNOME bug #150726.

1.1 (2005-04-24):

	* Enabled Hebrew localization.
	* Added French localization (courtesy of Jérôme Schell).
	* Added Italian localization (courtesy of Franco Spinelli).
	* Added Catalan localization (courtesy of Toni Hermoso).
	* Added Spanish localization (courtesy of Pat Carr).
	* Added German localization (courtesy of Christoph Vogelbusch).
	* Made the remaining strings (e.g. tray menu) localizable.
	* Allowed compilation on 64-bit platforms.
	* Added support for the New Mail led on ASUS computers
	  (Linux-specific).
	* Fixed a bug which made the Settings dialog fail to display
	  on non-US releases of Thunderbird and Suite. Those releases
	  know nothing about the en-US locale and therefore the
	  locale definition in chrome.rdf should be more detailed.

1.0.7 (2004-12-31):

	* Compiled for Thunderbird 1.0.
	* Ensure we catch 'biff' events from all accounts (by
	  using exactly the same method as Mozilla's "beep"
	  notification uses).
	  
1.0.6 (2004-11-19):

	* Updated as compatible with Thunderbird 0.9.
	* Jump to the first unread message when the
	  "New Mail" notification icon is clicked.
	* Fixed to compile on Solaris C++ compiler
	  (thanks to Jean-Christophe Collet from Sun).

1.0.5 (2004-10-01):

	* Updated to work on Thunderbird 0.8.
	* The build process now supports building separate XPIs for Suite
	  and for Thunderbird.
	* Improved the libegg tray code to alpha-blend with the desktop
	  theme. For more info:
	  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150726
	* Icon changed to:
	  mail/base/skin/icons/message-mail-new.png
	  and now embedded as a PNG with translucency.

1.0.4 (2004-08-21):

	* Fix installation on Mozilla Suite.
	* Add a proper transparency mask to the tray icon and make it centered.
	* Rename project to better indicate its functionality.

1.0.3 (2004-07-03):

	* Update to install on Mozilla Thunderbird 0.7 new extension manager.
	  
1.0.2 (2004-05-26):

	* Update for changes in Mozilla Thunderbird 0.6 / Mozilla 1.7.
	  (See bug 226270.)

1.0.1 (2004-02-14):

	* Update for changes in Mozilla Thunderbird 0.4.
	  (Works with Thunderbird 0.5 and Mozilla 1.6 as well.)
