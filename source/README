Mozilla New Mail Icon ("Biff") extension

VERSION: 1.0.7
AUTHOR: Ilya Konstantinov
LICENSE: Unclear at this point. Includes code from libegg and Mozilla. Might be illegal.

This Mozilla extension makes Mozilla Mail and Thunderbird display an icon in the system tray
when new mail arrives. It supports the standard (FreeDesktop.org) system tray, as used by GNOME,
KDE and IceWM (with 'icewmtray').

Compilation:
1. Run:
    make MOZILLA_PLATFORM=suite
   to build a version for Mozilla Suite, or:
    make MOZILLA_PLATFORM=tbird
   to build a version for Mozilla Thunderbird.
   
   Notes:

   * If your Mozilla includes are located in a different directory than mozilla-config
   indicates (e.g. in your Mozilla build directory), set it in the MOZILLA_INCLUDE_PATH
   environment variable. This can be handy to compile the extension with a private build
   of Mozilla.
   
   * To build a version for Mozilla Nightlies ('trunk branch'), run:

     make MOZ_TRUNK=1

Installation:
- In Mozilla Suite:
  Open the XPI file in Mozilla Suite ('File | Open' menu option,
  or by browsing to it).
- In Mozilla Thunderbird:
  Use the Extension Manager (available via 'Tools | Install Extension' menu option)
  to install the XPI file.

Share and enjoy!
