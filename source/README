Mozilla New Mail Icon ("Biff") extension

VERSION: 1.2.1
AUTHOR: Ilya Konstantinov
LICENSE: GNU General Public License
         (see COPYING for the complete license text)

This Mozilla extension makes Mozilla Mail and Thunderbird display an
icon in the system tray when new mail arrives. It supports the
standard (FreeDesktop.org) system tray, as used by GNOME, KDE and
IceWM (with 'icewmtray').

Compilation:

   To compile the extension, simply run 'make'. You might need to specify
   some of the options specified further on the 'make' command-line.

Compilation Options:

   MOZILLA_PLATFORM=(suite|tbird) *OBLIGATORY*

     Specifies what platform to target the build for. Possible
     options are 'suite' (for Mozilla Suite builds) and 'tbird'
     (for Thunderbird builds), e.g.:

       make MOZILLA_PLATFORM=tbird

   MOZ_TRUNK=1

     To build a version for an unreleased version of Thunderbird
     or Seamonkey ('trunk branch'), specify the MOZ_TRUNK option, e.g.:

       make MOZ_TRUNK=1

     This will attempt to use code adapted for recent Mozilla nightly
     releases and/or betas and release candidates, rather than code
     for the stable version this extension was intended for.
     Note, however, than the extension is not guaranteed to compile
     cleanly with whatever release you throw at it -- this merely
     selects a version of the code, if one exists, which is more fit
     for latest changes in the Mozilla code.

   DEBUG=1

     To build a debug version (no optimizations, with symbols) version
     of the extension's native component, specify the DEBUG option, e.g.:

       make DEBUG=1

   REAL_CONFIG=<path>

     If your 'mozilla-thunderbird-config' executable is located in a
     different location which is not in your path, use the REAL_CONFIG
     option to specify the real configuration script
     when invoking 'make', e.g.:

       make REAL_CONFIG=$HOME/mozilla-thunderbird-config

     As most distros don't come with a development(SDK) package for
     Thunderbird, you might need to build this extension with
     your build of Thunderbird. It is recommended to use the same
     original package as your distro used (e.g. by taking the distro's
     SRPM and rebuilding it). This option should point at the
     configuration script of that build.

Installation:

  In Mozilla Suite:

    Open the XPI file in Mozilla Suite ('File | Open' menu option,
    or by browsing to it).

  In Mozilla Thunderbird:

    Use the Extension Manager (available via 'Tools | Install
    Extension' menu option) to install the XPI file.
