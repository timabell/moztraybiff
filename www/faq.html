<p>
<span class="faq-question-q">Q:</span> Can you make the icon show all the time, regardless of having new mail, as
a handy shortcut to bring up Thunderbird?
</p>

<p>
<span class="faq-answer-a">A:</span>
This will be against the <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/">GNOME Human Interface Guidelines</a>, which
suggests icons should appear <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/">only to alert users of some event</a>. You probably know
how much those icons clutter the Taskbar on Windows XP machines, and we wouldn't want the same
to happen on GNOME. That's why I don't want to implement this feature.
</p>

<p>
However, it <em>is</em> handy to be able to switch to Thunderbird, whether
minimized or on a different workspace, so here's what I do: simply place a Thunderbird
icon on your panel (by dragging it from the Applications menu). Whenever you
click it, if Thunderbird is already running, it'll maximize.<br>

<p>
<span class="faq-question-q">Q:</span> After I install a newer version of the extension (e.g. 1.0.7) and restart Thunderbird, the old version (e.g. 1.0.5) still shows. How can I fix this?
</p>

<p>
<span class="faq-answer-a">A:</span> I am working on resolving this problem. Meanwhile, you can try a workaround:
<ol>
<li>Shut down Thunderbird.</li>
<li>Go to your Thunderbird's profile directory (should be in <code>~/.mozilla-thunderbird/.../</code>).</li>
<li>Go to the <code>extensions</code> directory.</li>
<li>Delete the <code>{2e1b75f1-6b5a-4f1d-89b4-424f636e4fba}</code> directory and all its contents.</li>
<li>Start Thunderbird and install the new version of the extension.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<span class="faq-question-q">Q:</span> Can I avoid being notified about new mail if it is "Junk mail"?
</p>

<p>
<span class="faq-answer-a">A:</span> This extension does not control the manner in which folders are marked as
having new mail. It doesn't perform any actions on its own -- it just obeys
Mozilla's notifications, the same notification that's used to play a sound
every time new mail is received. Therefore, such requests should not be addressed to me but to Mozilla
and Thunderbird developers -- and in fact, there are few issues reported
already:
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232104" title="&quot;delete mail marked as junk in this folder&quot; doesn't clear 'new' flag on account (or biff tray icon)">bug 232104</a> and
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11040" title="Allow filters to control biff UI (i.e. only notify me of "important" msg)">bug 11040</a>.
You can increase the likelyhood of those issues being addressed by 'voting'
for them on the Bugzilla site (see the above links).
